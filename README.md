INTRODUCTION

Mental health is very important to a person's overall health and well-being. Mental health is composed​ of emotional, physiological, and social aspects of our lives. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of changes to our lives whether it be work, school, the ability to leave the house, etc. As a result of these changes, our emotional, and psychological health, as well as our social lives have been impacted, and not necessarily for the better health impacts a person's overall health and well-being, and this includes a person's emotional, physiological, and social aspects of their life. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of changes have been brought into our lives. To address this topic, we used data sets about SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), MDE (major depressive episode), poverty, and reports of symptoms of depressive disorders. Our results may help us understand the effect of COVID-19 on adults' mental health in the United States.​

Methods

This project used R Version 4.0.3 and R Studio Version 1.3.1093 (R Core Team, 2020; R Studio Team, 2020-citation for R. The links are in the references section, and all graphs were made in R studio. To get the SNAP data, I went to the USDA website, clicked on SNAP data tables, and downloaded. To get the poverty data, I went to the US census website. The SNAP data was from SAMHSA website. The MDE data came from CDC.org. I downloaded this data set statistics at the national level from ( U.S. Census Bureau, Household Pulse Survey, 2020-2022)

Fig.1. Number of Reports from Adults of ages 18-80+ who responded weekly about experiencing symptoms of depressive disorder from Apr 23 to Dec 30,2020. Results were based on the number of reports of adults ages 18-80+ who reported symptoms of Depressive Disorder weekly from Apr 23 to Dec 30,2020

Discussions

There appears to be decrease then increase in number of subgroups 18-29 experiencing most symptoms of depressive order from Apr to Dec 2020 and the decrease in Ages 80+. The graph with how ages and MDE's are correlated show that the age group with the most MDE's are 18-29. In fact, approximately 200 people ages 18-29 said they had experienced symptoms of MDE.​ With the increase in SNAP users and an increase in people in poverty from 2019 to 2020 you can understand why there is an increase in major depressive episodes, especially with adults among the ages of 18-29. This specific group of adults are more vulnerable to because your early teens into your mid to late twenties are a very uncertain time in one's life..​
